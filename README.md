# SongTime
An website (or application?) that will take a song, and determine how long you counted in beats. 

Useful for when you're in the car (or you dont have access to a clock with seconds) so if theres a song playing in the background, you can just count the number of beats that passed. Then you can later input the song you were listening to, and how many beats/measures passed. 


# How to use

TODO: Change to spotify API, the one I'm using right now doesn't have uncommon/old songs. 

# Status: Very much WIP
