# SongTime
An website (or application?) that will take a song, and determine how long you counted in beats. 

Useful for when you're in the car (or you dont have access to a clock with seconds) so if theres a song playing in the background, you can just count the number of beats that passed. Then you can later input the song you were listening to, and how many beats/measures passed.
